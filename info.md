1. Exchange
An exchange is a marketplace where people trade assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Modern exchanges mostly work digitally, using automated systems to match buyers and sellers.

2. Orders
An order is a request to buy or sell an asset at a certain price. Key properties of an order include:

Owner: Who placed the order.

Product: What is being traded (e.g., stocks, bonds, crypto).

Quantity: How much of the product is being traded.

Price: The desired price for the trade.

Validity: How long the order remains active.

3. Bid and Ask Orders
A Bid Order (BUY order) represents the highest price someone is willing to pay for an asset. The highest bid is called the best bid.

An Ask Order (SELL order) is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The lowest ask is called the best ask.

4. Order Matching
Orders are matched based on price and time priority.

A BUY order executes immediately if there’s a SELL order at the same price or lower.

A SELL order executes immediately if there’s a BUY order at the same price or higher.

If there’s no match, the order remains in the order book until a matching order appears.

5. Order Book
An order book shows all active buy and sell orders at different price levels.

The left side (Bid side) shows all buy orders and their quantities.

The right side (Ask side) shows all sell orders and their quantities.

If no buy price meets the lowest sell price, the market is uncrossed (no trading happens).

If buy prices exceed or meet sell prices, the market is crossed, meaning trading happens.

6. Priority (Price-Time Priority)
If multiple orders could be matched, priority is determined by:

Price – The order with the best price gets matched first.

Time – If multiple orders have the same price, the earliest one gets executed first.

7. Market Making
Market makers provide liquidity by constantly placing both buy and sell orders, profiting from the small difference between the bid and ask prices.
Example: A currency exchange at an airport buys USD at €0.95 and sells USD at €1.05, making a profit of €0.10 per dollar exchanged.
